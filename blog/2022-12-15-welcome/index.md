Welcome!  I'm excited to share with you my first effort at an open-source side project:  **ToPaML**!
I'm passionate about the practical application of probability theory.  Its utilization is a daily part of my life.  [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/) are to thank for developing the technology that allows me to seemlessly utilize [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), [YAML](https://yaml.org/), [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and code snippets in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to make this project user-friendly and technically much easier. Also, a big thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for **free** hosting,  and of course special credits due to [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

## What is ToPaML?
In short, **ToPaML** is an acronym.  It stands for the **Theory of Probability and Machine Learning**.  In long, its a shortened acronym which represetns the entire title of this book:  

#### The Open-Source Guide to the Theory of Probability and Machine Learning

The book is an amalgamation of professional knowledge I've aggregated from those that came before me.
I decided it wasn't practical to have an open-source book with such a 
long title as the [url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL).  Therefore, I needed an acronym. 

1. One that was available from a [DNS hosting service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hosting_service). 
2. Short enough to make it easy to search on the internet. 
3. Representative of the content.  

It was immediately apparent to me that **TOSGttToPaML** was far too long.  Hence, **ToPaML** was birthed.  I always wanted to write a text book so I'm happy that the internet is able to make this all possible.  I don't have a PhD, just lots of applied experience along with many research papers and textbooks I've read.     

## Who is Charolee Chanard?

[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:



The blog supports tags as well!

**And if you don't want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config.
